ConfigCat SDK for C++ provides easy integration for your application to ConfigCat.

ConfigCat is a feature flag and configuration management service that lets you separate releases from deployments. You can turn your features ON/OFF using [ConfigCat Dashboard](http://app.configcat.com) even after they are deployed. ConfigCat lets you target specific groups of users based on region, email or any other custom user attribute.

ConfigCat is a [hosted feature flag service](http://configcat.com). Manage feature toggles across frontend, backend, mobile, desktop apps. [Alternative to LaunchDarkly](https://configcat.com/launchdarkly-vs-configcat). Management app + feature flag SDKs.
